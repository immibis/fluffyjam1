This mod adds Totally Random Surgery to the game.
But before we even get into surgery, you will need to know how to not die.
You should know that this mod adds excrement to Minecraft. Yes, Steve now
needs to use the toilet. Call me weird if you want, but the mod would be
pretty pointless if I didn't add that. I am not responsible if you give this
mod to someone immature, and they start throwing their poop at you in-game.

Notes:
* Any modifications made to a player will be reverted when they die.
* Do not, under any circumstances, mine sludge with a machine.

=== ABOUT BASIC HEALTH ===

After you install this mod and start the game, the first thing you'll
notice is that you have 6 bars in the bottom right of your screen.
This mod overrides some vanilla gameplay features - in particular, food.

NOTE: In creative, you are unable to eat, so you will always die. Either
don't use creative, or switch to survival to eat.

If you've just started a new world, or respawned, some of the bars will be
fluctuating wildly. This is normal, they will settle down in about 10-20
seconds.

From top to bottom, the bars show:

* The level of food in your blood.
  Your food bar also shows this.
  If it is low, you need to eat.
  If it is empty, you will soon die.
* The level of water in your blood.
  If it is low, right click on a water source block to drink it.

* The fullness of your bladder. Actually, this is connected to Sensor 1, which
  can be rewired with surgery to show something else.
  If this is full (and hasn't been rewired) you will make a mess. Before that
  happens, stand on a toilet, or in the middle of the wilderness, and press P.
* The fullness of your colon. Connected to Sensor 2 which can also be rewired.
  If this is full you will probably die. Before that happens, stand on a toilet,
  or in the middle of the wilderness, and press O.
  If it is mostly full you will digest things more slowly.

* Your overall health level (actually, how healthy your brain is).
  If this gets below half, you will start taking damage.
  If this is empty, you will take a lot of damage and quickly die.
  If this is less than full, your screen will be darkened.

* The level of oxygen in your blood. When you are underwater, your air bar shows this.
  If it is empty, you will soon die.
  This will not refill immediately after you leave water - it will take a few seconds.
  Even if you are not underwater this will not quite be full. That's just an oddity of how
  things work.
  You will notice that you don't have very much capacity for oxygen.
  
If any of these things are in need of attention they will flash red.

=== ABOUT TOILETS ===

T-O.I.L.E.Ts (Terrain-Outflow Intelligent Liquid Extraction Terminals) can be crafted using the following recipe:

..U   . = nothing
#U/   / = stick
.##   # = cobblestone
      U = water bucket

Place one above a large empty space. They will scan for empty space up to 12 blocks in each horizontal direction, and
downwards as far as possible. The maximum size that can be used is a 25xNx25 cuboid, with the T-O.I.L.E.T. in the top centre,
and with N as large as possible (from the T-O.I.L.E.T. down to bedrock)

If you have trouble clearing out the space, why not try a ravine?

To use a T-O.I.L.E.T. press O or P while standing on it. You must be standing mainly on the T-O.I.L.E.T. Do not
stand halfway between the T-O.I.L.E.T. and another block. Do not use a T-O.I.L.E.T. with an insufficient amount of empty
space available.

=== ABOUT OPERATING TABLES ===

Operating tables are crafted like so:

ABC   A = iron axe
WWW   B = iron sword
 D    C = iron pickaxe
      W = wool
      D = bed

(the tools are what you use to operate on patients)

To lay on an operating table, right-click it. Because operating tables are fake beds, and I am lazy,
the time will be locked to approximately midnight when anyone is in an operating table, or when anyone
right-clicks an operating table. I am sure this will be extensively abused.
Operating tables also only work in the overworld.

If you are in singleplayer, you will see a GUI and be able to operate on yourself.
If you are in multiplayer, you will see the usual bed GUI.
Someone else must right-click the operating table to operate on you.

If more than one person tries to operate on you, glitches will happen. If the server is laggy, the
GUI will be desynced from reality. Again, lazy (actually because of limited time).

=== ABOUT OPERATING ===

In the operating table GUI, you will see the player's internal organs and connections between them.
This is a 2D grid of tiles - like how Minecraft is made of blocks.
Use thse arrow keys to scroll around.

Grey dots show empty tiles that you can build on.

The icons on the right are for mode selection.
The first mode is "Examine" mode. In this mode, move the mouse over any tile for more information.
The second mode is "Place pipes" mode. In this mode, you can create and connect pipes, which
transport substances inside the player's body. Pipes can cross over and create T-junctions.
The third mode is "Remove pipes" mode. This mode allows you to remove pipes.
  IMPORTANT NOTE ON REMOVE PIPES MODE:
        v     to remove this pipe
    --------  (pretend these dashes are pipe segments)
       ^^^    highlight these three pipes
    
The fourth mode allows you to move some organs around. Movable organs will be highlighted in green.
Drag one to any empty tile. Steve starts with some spart parts in his legs, for some reason.

To switch modes, click on their icons, or press the '1', '2', '3' or '4' key.

Things you can try if you want to learn the system:
* Disconnect a leg.
* Reconnect the leg.
* Disconnect a kidney.
* Try to optimize some piping, to reduce the number of pipes used. (this won't have much effect but you
  will practice placing and removing pipes) 
* Move the storage tanks away from the spare kidneys, using mode 4, to make room for more pipes.
* Connect the spare kidneys in parallel with the existing ones. If you drink lots of water it should be
  processed faster.
* Connect more intestines in parallel, for faster digestion.
* Connect more intestines in series, for more thorough digestion.
