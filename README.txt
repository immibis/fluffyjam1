This mod adds random stuff to the game - the end. For more information see README-mod.txt. This is the README for GitHub.

Do not be surprised if some parts of this code are not very readable or have badly named fields/methods/classes/variables.
Some parts are deliberately obfuscated slightly (e.g. shortened variable names) to make it
more difficult to guess what they do without actually running the mod. 

Also much of it was written to favour speed of initial development over future maintainability, due to the limited time allowed.
